This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis on customer transactional data using Python. RFM is a method used to analyze customer behavior and segment customers based on how recently, how often, and how much they have purchased. This can be a valuable tool for targeted marketing and improving customer retention strategies.
